=================================================

Environment
=================================================
Multiple colors for key, door - correct key, door combo gives +2, wrong gives +1
x, y added to observation

Architectures
=================================================
tanh activation for LSTM in RMQN

Hyperparameter changes
=================================================
n_episodes: 5k to 15k
exploration_steps: 500000 to 1000000
state_length: 20 to 50



20 Nov
=================================================

Environment
=================================================
One hot given by environment instead of calculating later
5x5 map
x, y removed from observation
2000 time limit

Architectures
=================================================
Epochs = 1 for DRQN, RMQN (RMQN might have some problems)

Hyperparameter changes
=================================================
n_episodes: 2k to 5k (no early stopping)



18 Nov
=================================================

Environment
=================================================
Key seen added to observation
Added x,y to observation
Size reduced to 7x7
Max time 5000
Reward for key removed
Only one key (red) and one door (blue)

So the problem now is to take the key and then go to the door.
Observation is  (surrounding colors, x, y, key_seen) - total 8 features

Architectures
=================================================
DRQN, RMQN added - Working but not 100% sure about the LSTM layer in RMQN
Observation is one-hot encoded before sending to the networks

Hyperparameter changes
=================================================
state_length: 4 to 20
n_episodes: 12k to 2k (with additional condition to stop when 20 consecutive episodes time out)
exploration_steps: 1m to 500k
init_replay_size: 20k to 50k
