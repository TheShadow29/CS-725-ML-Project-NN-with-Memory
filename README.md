# CS-725-ML-Project-NN-with-Memory

'models' folder contains code for agents. Agents are expected to have an interface like the DQN agent.

'saved_networks' folder contains models saved using Keras save_weights function. They can be loaded using load_weights function.

'util' is for preprocessing input to expected type.
